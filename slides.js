    title: "Scarcity Forces Tradeoffs",
    description: "Through unlimited wants and limited resources, <mark>scarcity</mark> forces people to choose what they have, forcing <mark>trade-offs</mark> they sometimes aren’t even aware of. These trade-offs aren’t limited to money, as they also include time and opportunities lost to the chosen want/service/opportunity. The second choice option that was lost in a trade off is known as the <mark>opportunity cost</mark>.",

This can be very subjective, as the <mark>benefits</mark> and <mark>costs</mark> are the money, time, effort, experience, or improvement that mainly relate to the person comparing their options.",
